# Phrasync v0.4.4 — GitHub source release

- Manually added lyric cues remain visible during playback and MP4 export even when they overlap transcribed cues. Existing projects with untimed manual cues are also handled.
- New manual cues use the playhead's lyric timing offset correctly, and editing an active cue refreshes its preview immediately.
- The Microsoft Store package is not part of this GitHub source release. Store v0.4.3 is still in certification; v0.4.4 will be submitted after it is approved.

# Phrasync v0.4.3 — Microsoft Store submission

This release makes updates and troubleshooting more reliable.

- Fixed a WebView2 cache mismatch that could leave controls unresponsive after an in-place Store update. The desktop document and static resources now use versioned URLs and fresh-cache rules.
- Added Settings → App updates. Store-installed copies can check for future releases and request installation directly from Phrasync, with the user's consent. Portable preview copies explain why Store updates are unavailable.
- Added a Diagnostics panel with recent errors and relevant Windows, CPU, GPU, RAM, app-version, and disk information. Reports can be copied or downloaded for support; users should review them before sharing.
- Kept the 0.4.2 export fixes: choose an output folder before rendering, open selected or default render folders, save MP4 through the native Windows dialog, and render Japanese lyrics with a suitable fallback font.

**One-time transition for existing users:** If an earlier Phrasync version is installed, manually uninstall it and install v0.4.3 from Microsoft Store. This is recommended once to clear any stale WebView2 data from the previous installation. Back up important projects before uninstalling. Future Store updates can be checked and installed from Settings → App updates without manually visiting the Store listing.

The Store's in-app installation path cannot be exercised end-to-end in this portable preview; it must be verified with a Store-installed package when a subsequent release becomes available.

# Phrasync v0.4.2

This update fixes Windows desktop video export.

- Choose the output folder before starting an MP4 render. The rendered file is written directly there.
- Open the renders folder from the export window, including the folder containing a completed video.
- Download MP4 now opens a native Save As dialog in the Windows app; the browser version keeps a normal download link.
- Export controls are available in English and Italian.
- The built-in Phrasync renders folder has a dedicated button even when a different export folder is selected.
- Japanese lyrics now use a Japanese-capable font only where the selected font lacks glyphs; a freely licensed fallback font is bundled for PCs without Japanese system fonts.

# Phrasync v0.3.0

Released 2026-09-08.

This release makes the Store desktop experience substantially lighter and fixes live model-download reporting.

## Highlights

- Whisper model progress now counts Hugging Face's active `.incomplete` payload, so percentage, transferred size, speed, and ETA advance throughout the first download.
- The Windows WebView2 host explicitly enables GPU compositing and GPU canvas rasterization.
- Expensive preview canvases are capped at 30 FPS during playback and 12 FPS while idle, independently from full-quality video export.
- High-DPI preview and timeline buffers are constrained inside the desktop host, eliminating unnecessary multi-million-pixel redraws.
- The timeline no longer repaints continuously while playback is stopped, and hidden windows pause preview work.
- Costly translucent backdrop blurs are replaced with opaque desktop surfaces while preserving the same visual hierarchy.
- The Phrasync logo is now embedded in the Windows executable for the window, taskbar, and application switcher.

## Verified for this release

- The active Hugging Face cache layout is covered by an automated progress-counting regression test.
- The packaged executable and Microsoft Store MSIX are tested separately from the browser development build.
- The Windows package uses the existing Store identity and version **0.3.0.0**.

# Phrasync v0.2.0

Released 2026-09-08.

This release turns the Store build into a native Windows experience and makes first-run AI setup transparent.

## Highlights

- Phrasync now opens in its own Windows WebView2 application window, with no Command Prompt and no browser tab.
- The first-run overlay explains that each Whisper model is downloaded once and stored locally.
- Model downloads now show percentage, transferred size, and estimated time remaining before transcription begins.
- English is the default interface language; users can switch between English and Italian from the onboarding overlay or the main toolbar.
- NVIDIA CUDA acceleration is detected automatically, with an explicit GPU/CPU status shown in the interface.
- CUDA 12 cuBLAS and cuDNN 9 runtime libraries are included in the Windows Store package so compatible NVIDIA systems do not require a separate CUDA Toolkit installation.

## Verified for this release

- The packaged GUI executable opens a native window titled **Phrasync** and does not create a console window.
- The packaged health check reports Phrasync 0.2.0, Faster-Whisper available, CUDA available, and one NVIDIA device on an RTX 3090 test system.
- English and Italian onboarding layouts were visually verified at 1440 × 1000.
- The complete suite reports **56 passing tests**.
- The Microsoft Store MSIX uses the existing product identity and version **0.2.0.0**.

# Phrasync v0.1.1

Released 2026-08-27.

This patch removes the final-export limitation for Odyssey and world-space typography.

## Highlights

- Odyssey 3D MP4 export now uses the same Three.js/WebGL scene engine as the live preview instead of being blocked by preflight.
- World-space 3D typography exports as real volumetric WebGL geometry over Odyssey, built-in dynamic visuals, images, and videos.
- Flat kinetic typography over Odyssey keeps the WebGL environment and is composited during the final H.264 pass.
- Chrome or Edge runs headlessly for deterministic frame generation; WebCodecs produces H.264 and FFmpeg muxes the original audio into the final MP4.
- Odyssey Flat retains a deterministic CPU raster export path for systems and projects that do not need the WebGL scene.
- The critic now reports the selected WebGL export path as an informational note instead of raising the former preview-only blocking errors.
- Added an explicit `websockets` runtime dependency for the local Chrome DevTools connection.

## Verified for this release

- Real MP4 smoke renders pass for Odyssey 3D with 3D text, Odyssey 3D with flat text, and Aurora with 3D text.
- Every smoke output decodes successfully through FFmpeg.
- The complete suite reports **52 passing tests**.
- The updated server was verified on Windows 11 with OCR, Faster-Whisper, and CUDA still available after restart.

## Current limits

- WebGL MP4 export requires a local Chrome or Edge installation with WebCodecs support.
- Long high-resolution WebGL exports can use substantial browser memory while the encoded H.264 stream is assembled.
- Odyssey Flat is a CPU raster interpretation; choose Odyssey 3D when preview-faithful lighting and geometry are required.
- Linux and macOS launchers remain source-level supported but were not physically verified for this patch.

# Phrasync v0.1.0

This is the first public release: useful today, intentionally honest about what still needs engineering.

## Highlights

- Two first-class project modes: **Lyric Video** for music and **Subtitles** for spoken audio or video.
- A video selected in Subtitles mode becomes the transcription source, preview footage, render background, and final audio source without duplicate setup.
- Hierarchical local Faster-Whisper transcription: ten-second language mapping, confidence and silence filtering, stable span smoothing, quiet-boundary snapping, language-locked span decoding, phrase-level language verification, selective corrective re-reading, adaptive fallback, and persisted gauntlet diagnostics.
- Auto follows language changes across a track; one code locks a language, comma-separated codes restrict the candidate set, and `single` keeps one automatically detected language.
- Language metadata is preserved on cues and returned as a dominant language, ordered language list, editable API-level span map, confidence, and diagnostics.
- Seven kinetic 2D typography presets with browser/Python timing parity.
- Seven separately named and tuned 3D typography personalities with independent world-space X/Y offsets.
- Grounded world-space 3D text: phrases are planted on the scene floor and the camera travels past them like other meshes.
- Odyssey 3D environments for Japan, Italy, China, and the USA.
- Manual rain, snow, fog, storms, falling leaves, dawn, day, sunset, night, and four seasons.
- **Automatic journey** mode crossfades daytime and seasonal colour while selecting deterministic weather from the playback clock.
- Image, video, and dynamic backgrounds; local project save/load; critic preflight; cancellable render jobs; H.264 MP4 download and postflight decoding.

## Verified for this release

- 50 automated tests pass in the current release environment.
- A real short MP4 render passes with one video file used for both picture and audio in Subtitles mode.
- Chrome smoke coverage passes for every 2D/3D text composition state over Odyssey 3D, a 2D dynamic visual, image, and video modes; actual MP4 decoding is covered by the integration render above.
- 3D text remains world-planted and completes its fly-past at scene speeds of 20%, 100%, and 260%.
- Weather, daytime, seasons, automatic state changes, project-mode copy, and the 3D preset catalogue pass in the live browser with zero captured exceptions.
- Repeated 244.9-second `large-v3` Auto runs map Italian, Portuguese, French, Spanish, English, and Japanese; recover the opening lyrics; preserve Japanese writing; follow late line-level switches; and produce no false outro after the final vocal.
- Development and physical testing were performed on Windows 11, Ryzen 9 3900X, 32 GB RAM, and RTX 3090 24 GB. Linux and macOS launchers are included but not physically release-tested yet.

## Known limits

- Odyssey Flat, Odyssey 3D, and 3D typography are preview-only in v0.1.0. MP4 preflight blocks them explicitly because the Python renderer does not yet reproduce WebGL output faithfully.
- Full song-length output has not yet been rendered. Current verification uses short engineering renders; complete music videos will be added after publication.
- Projects reference media in the local Phrasync workspace rather than embedding it into a portable archive.
- Browser video preview is intentionally limited to MP4 and WebM; convert MOV, MKV, AVI, and unusual codecs before import.
- The transcription workflow performs strongly on the tested songs, but expressive singing, unusual pronunciation, effects, and closely related languages can still need human review.
- There is no signed installer, automatic updater, or hosted web version.

## Evaluated next-step technology

- Troika Three Text for SDF-quality, multilingual 3D typography.
- JASSUB/libass for professional ASS subtitle parity in browser preview.
- Three.js Sky for physically based atmosphere when deterministic export parity is ready.
- three.quarks only if future VFX outgrow the lightweight deterministic weather system.
