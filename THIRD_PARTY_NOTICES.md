# Third-party notices

Phrasync is licensed under Apache-2.0. Its dependencies and tools remain under their respective licenses; the Phrasync license does not replace those terms. See `NOTICE` for the project's attribution notice.

## FFmpeg

Phrasync uses FFmpeg for media probing, decoding, audio conversion, and H.264 export. It prefers a system FFmpeg executable and otherwise uses the binary supplied by `imageio-ffmpeg`.

The Windows development environment used for version 0.1.0 had `imageio-ffmpeg` 0.6.0 and an FFmpeg 7.1 binary configured with GPL/version-3 options and libx264. That exact binary is therefore GPL-covered. Other operating systems or future package versions may supply a different build; inspect the actual binary with `ffmpeg -version` before distributing it.

- FFmpeg license and compliance information: <https://ffmpeg.org/legal.html>
- FFmpeg source: <https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#get-sources>
- imageio-ffmpeg: <https://github.com/imageio/imageio-ffmpeg>
- x264: <https://www.videolan.org/developers/x264.html>

When shipping a portable build, preserve applicable copyright and license notices, document the exact FFmpeg build, and provide the corresponding source or written/source-access mechanism required by that build's license. Do not describe the whole bundle as if every component were licensed only under Apache-2.0.

## Python and browser-side dependencies

The Python requirements include FastAPI, Uvicorn, NumPy, Pillow, Faster-Whisper/CTranslate2, Hugging Face Hub, audio-analysis packages, OCR packages, and their transitive dependencies. Browser-side code in this repository is project code unless a file says otherwise. Consult the installed package metadata and upstream projects for the exact versions and license texts included in a release.

Before publishing a binary release, generate a version-pinned dependency inventory and include the required notices with the artifact. This file is a release checklist and attribution summary, not legal advice.
